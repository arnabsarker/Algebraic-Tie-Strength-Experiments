# Algebraic-Tie-Strength-Experiments
Scripts for computing Edge PageRank and Hodge Decomposition, as described in the work

- Sarker, A., Seby, J. B., Benson, A. R., & Jadbabaie, A. (2021). Which Bridges Are Weak Ties? Algebraic Topological Insights on Network Structure and Tie Strength. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.02091.

This repository contains two files: 

- [SimplicialLaplacians.jl](SimplicialLaplacians.jl), which contains helper functions for computing matrices related to Edge PageRank and Hodge Decomposition
- [GetEdgePR.jl](GetEdgePR.jl), which computes Edge PageRank vectors and their Hodge Decomposition for a particular dataset.

Data should be structured as in the corresponding repository for data, [here](https://github.com/arnabsarker/Algebraic-Tie-Strength-Data).
